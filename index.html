    <h1>How to Divide By Zero</h1>
    <p>
      How to divide by zero, and other things you will learn in highschool
      calculus. This will give you an <b>overview</b> of calculus. This will
      <i>not</i> replace your calculus textbook. This will help you understand
      what you are learning in class, and why. When I first learned calculus we
      focused on the mechanics of solving problems. I wish we'd spent more time
      discussing <b>why</b> we were learning these things and what they meant.
    </p>
    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone who is about to start highschool calculus.</li>
      <li>Someone who studied calculus in highschool but doesn't know why.</li>
      <li>Someone who enjoys math and wants a different perspective.</li>
      <li>Me, back when I first started studying this subject.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
    <p>
      You need to remember some algebra to understand this document. Here is a
      quick refresher of the relevant facts. You will need a lot more algebra
      when you are ready to actually solve calculus problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Graphs of Functions</h2>
    <p>
      You should be familiar with graphs of functions. Graphs are the easiest
      way to explain and understand calculus.
    </p>

      ><img src="./rough-draft-images/0100.png" />
      <div><code>2 - x²</code> Click for an interactive graph.</div></a
    >
    <div class="phil-notes">
      The words currently say “left” and “bottom.” Change that as needed. (Most
      of the graphs described below include negative numbers.)
    </div>
    <p>
      The numbers along the bottom of the graph are the inputs to the function.
      These are often things that you can change. We often call this “the x
      axis.” The numbers along the left side of the graph are the outputs from
      the function. If you give your computer or calculator an input to a
      function, it can compute the output of that function. This is “the y
      axis.” Or sometimes we say <code>f(x)</code> instead of y.
    </p>
    <h2>Slope of a Line</h2>
    <p>Slope is defined as “<span style="color: green">rise</span> over <span style="color: red">run</span>.”</p>

      In graph above you can see that the function moves <span style="color: green">2 units <i>up</i></span> every
      time it moves <span style="color: red">3 units <i>to the left</i></span>. So the slope is
      <code>2 ÷ 3</code>, or ⅔.

      You could also say that the function moves <span style="color:violet">4 units up</span> every time it moves
      <span style="color:blue">6 units to the left</span>. And it moves <span style="color:orange">6 units up</span> each time it moves <span style="color:#999">9 units to
      the left</span>.
      <code>2 ÷ 3</code>, <code>4 ÷ 6</code>, and <code>6 ÷ 9</code> all give
      you the same answer, ⅔.

      In the next graph notice that <code>g(x) = 2x ÷ 3 + 1</code> has different values than
      <code>f(x) = 2x ÷ 3</code>, but they both have lines with the same slope.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Plot f(x) and g(x) on the same graph. Show triangles on both.
    </div>
    <p>This graph shows a line going down, so it has a negative slope.</p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Plot <code>f(x) = -2x ÷ 3</code>. Keep the same scale for all of the
      graphs in this section except this one. This one needs more space in the y
      &lt; 0 area.

    <div class="phil-notes">‼️ Plot <code>f(x) = 2</code></div>
    <p>If the line is vertical, its slope is <i>undefined</i>.</p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw a vertical line at y=2 and nothing else. Keep the same size graph
      in all of these examples.
    </div>

    <h1>Limits</h1>
    <p>
      Limits are a way to divide by zero and otherwise make infinity work for
      you. In class you will learn a more precise definition of limits, and a
      lot of rules to help you compute them. You might have to use limits
      directly to solve some problems. Mostly you learn about limits so you can
      understand the definitions of derivatives and integrals, described below.
    </p>
    <h2>Smoothness</h2>
    <p>
      Calculus focuses on smooth functions. There is a formal definition of
      smoothness, but your intuition is right. Let's look at some examples.
    </p>
    <p><code>x²</code> (x squared) is smooth everywhere.</p>
    <div class="phil-notes">‼️ Plot <code>x²</code></div>
    <p>
      <code>|x|</code> (the absolute value of x) is smooth everywhere except at
      x = 0.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">‼️ Plot <code>|x|</code></div>
    <p>
      <code>n!</code> (n factorial) is not continuous, so it can't be smooth.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">‼️ Plot <code>n!</code></div>
    <p>
      Smoothness is the opposite of a fractal. No matter how much you zoom into
      a fractal you'll always find places where the function is not smooth.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Example: See what I can find on the internet. Maybe the thing where
      each line segment gets replaces by a V. Show three of these next to each
      other. Each one should highlight a certain “detail” area, with an arrow
      pointing to the next picture. Maybe a number, like “9⨉”, to make it clear
      that I'm zooming in. Can I animate the process of zooming in? Seems easy
      to write in JavaScript, and it will repeat.
    </div>

    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Title: How long is the coast of Britain. Lots of good pictures on
      google. 😀
    </div>
    <p>
      If you zoom into a smooth function enough, it will eventually look like a
      straight line. That makes the function very easy to predict.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ I'd like a simple animation here. On the left side is a function, maybe
      sin(x). One the right is a zoomed in area. Similar to the last two ‼️'s.
      But, over time the highlighted area in the left panel gets smaller and
      smaller. And the contents of the right panel keep growing. On a loop. Can
      I insert an iframe here? An animated gif?
    </div>

    <h2>Filling in Missing Values</h2>
    <p>
      Let's look at the function <code>f(x) = x³ ÷ x</code>. Naively you might
      simplify that to <code>x²</code>. That's almost right, but remember that
      you are not allowed to divide by zero. So you should really say
      <code>x³ ÷ x = x²</code>, but only when <code>x ≠ 0</code>.
      <code>x³ ÷ x</code> is <i>undefined</i> when x = 0.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Graph <code>x²</code>, but only when <code>x ≠ 0</code>. Presumably
      there's a hollow circle at x=0. Presumably I'm getting most of these
      charts from another tool, so I'll let it do it's thing. What's the name of
      that free on line graphing calculator? Desmos I think.
    </div>
    <p>
      In simpler terms, <code>x³ ÷ x</code> looks a lot like <code>x²</code>,
      but it has a hole it it!
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Show graphs of Graph <code>x²</code>, but only when <code>x ≠ 0</code>,
      and normal <code>x²</code>. “normal” one is first / on the left (to match
      the text below.)
    </div>
    <p>
      If you only had the second graph, you could probably guess what the first
      graph looks like! You could fill in that missing value with anything you
      want, but only one value would make the function smooth. Congratulations,
      you just computed a limit! Calculus class will teach you when it is okay
      to use the complete version of the function, rather than the original
      version with the hole.
    </p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      If you see delta and epsilon in a problem, it is probably talking about
      limits. These are written with lowercase Greek letters: 𝛿 and 𝜺.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ I bet google has a great image of a delta-epsilon proof. Be sure to
      link back to the page I stole it from!
    </div>

    <h1>Derivatives</h1>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      A derivate is a rate of change. For example, lets say
      <code>f(x)</code> tells us the total number of cookies in your house at a
      given time. Then the derivate of <code>f(x)</code> tells us how quickly
      you are eating those cookies or baking new ones.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ A graph. Y axis is labeled “cookies.” X axis is labeled “time.” A
      straight line is going down at a rate of 1 cookie per second. Avoid
      negative numbers.
    </div>
    <p>
      This graph shows that the number of cookies goes down over time. That
      means someone is eating your cookies! The graph would go up if you baked
      or bought more cookies. Also notice that <code>f(x)</code> is continuous
      and <i>smooth</i>. That means that someone is eating a little bit of a
      cookie at a time, continuously. Alternatively, what if whole cookies were
      disappearing at once? Then the graph might look like this.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Same scale and axes as as above. But we have a sequence of horizontal
      lines going down like a staircase. The lines will be in the same general
      position as in the previous graph. Like we took <i>samples</i> from the
      first graph, then tried to fill in the remaining spaces with a horizontal
      line segment. Each segment has a closed circle on the left and an open
      circle on the right.
    </div>
    <p>
      This function is <i>not</i> smooth everywhere. We can only talk about the
      derivative where it is smooth. Where it is not smooth, we say the derivate
      is not defined.
    </p>
    <h2>Derivate of a Line</h2>
    <p>
      Our cookie example is a straight line. The derivative of a line is the
      slope of the line. In this case someone is eating one cookie per minute.
      The rate of change is -1 cookies per minute.
    </p>
    <h2>Smaller Pieces</h2>
    <p>
      This example is a little more complicated. You could say that the
      <i>average</i> rate of change for the first 5 minutes is -1, just like the
      previous graph. That's correct, but it's leaving out a lot of details.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw a graph where the main line follows the four sections below. Also
      draw a lighter or dotted line showing a straight line that starts ands
      ends at the same place. That should have a slope of -1.
    </div>
    <p>
      Let's break the graph into pieces. - For the first minute the graph has a
      slope of 2, so the derivative in that section is 2. - For the next two
      minutes the slope is -1, and so is the derivative. - Then the graph jumps
      down by 5. - For the last two minutes the slope is 0, and so is the
      derivate. Here's a graph of the derivative. Notice that the derivative is
      only defined where the original function is (a) defined, (b) continuous,
      and (c) smooth.
    </p>
    <h2>Really Small Pieces</h2>
    <p>So, what's the derivative of x²?</p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw a graph of x². x goes from -1 to 4. To save space y goes from -1
      to 10. So the line will go off the top of the graph somewhere between x=3
      and x=4. Label the x axis with an “x”. Label the y axis with “y = x²”.
    </div>
    <p>
      You could say that the <i>average</i> rate of change between 0 and 1 is 1.
      And the average rate of change between 1 and 2 is 3. If you keep going
      you'll get a graph like this for the derivative x².
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Keep the previous graph and add new lines in a different color. Draw
      straight lines connecting this series of points (-1, 1), (0,0), (1,1),
      (2,4), (3,9), (4,16). Add a second graph below the first. The x axis
      scales should line up perfectly. The y axis on the bottom should be
      labeled “y' = the derivative of x²”. Fill in the values. These should each
      be horizontal segments with open circles on both sides.
    </div>
    <p>
      But there's no reason to break things up that way. What if you asked for
      the average every time x changes by ½? Then the answers would look like
      this graph.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Just like the previous pair of graphs, but draw twice as many points.
      x=0, x=0.5, x=1, x=1.5, etc.
    </div>
    <p>
      As you look at smaller and smaller sections, you see more an more detail.
      How small can we make the sections?
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Similar to previous two illustrations, but make the sections much
      smaller. Look at the result to decide how small to make these. It should
      still be obvious that these are separate segments, but, clearly getting
      closer to smooth.
    </div>
    <p>
      As we get closer and closer to 0, the answer gets better and better. What
      if we asked about a change of 0? Every time x moves 0 units to the left,
      x² moves 0 units up. And <code>0 ÷ 0</code> = <i>what?</i>
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw 2 graphs. On top, just x² without anything else. On the bottom
      draw the graph of 2x.
    </div>
    <p>
      And that's why we learn limits before we learn derivatives. When you work
      out the problem in class you'll eventually learn that the derivative of
      <code>x²</code> is <code>2x</code>, matching what we see on the graph. But
      along the way to <code>2x</code> you'd see something (roughly) similar to
      <code>2x² ÷ x</code>. Because you know limits you can simplify
      <code>2x² ÷ x</code> to <code>2x</code> without being afraid to divide by
      0.
    </p>
    <h2>Physics Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Derivatives are used a lot in physics. For example, if f(x) is the
      <i>position</i> of your car at time x, then the derivative of f(x) will
      tell you the <i>speed</i> you are going.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw two charts, one on top of the other with matching scales for the x
      axes, as in the previous section. label the x axis for both “x =
      position”. The y axis for the top graph is “y = distance (miles)”, for the
      bottom graph “y = speed (miles/hour)”. Mark the first part of the x axis
      “my neighborhood”, the second part “surface roads”, the third part
      “freeway,” and the fourth part “surface roads,” again. The position graph
      will be a little wavy, but definitely the slowest in the neighborhood and
      the fastest on the freeway. Draw light/thin lines on the top chart, like
      before, from the beginning to the end of each section. On the bottom chart
      show two different lines in different colors. One labeled average speed,
      and the other labeled speed.
    </div>
    <p>
      Just like in the example above, you can talk about the average speed for
      your entire trip. Or you can talk about the average speed for various
      parts of your trip. You can get more precise answers if you look at
      smaller and smaller time intervals. And, if you ask for the
      <i>exact</i> speed at an <i>exact</i> instant in time, that's the
      derivative. Acceleration is the derivative of speed. Electric current is
      the derivative of charge. Etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Interest Rates</h2>
    <p>
      Interest is money the bank puts into your your account. Your account
      balance will change over time because the bank is adding money. If
      <code>f(x)</code> represents your bank balance, then the derivate of
      <code>f(x)</code> says how quickly the bank is adding money. Bankers often
      quote interest rates in different ways. They might quote a rate for a
      year. But they add money more than once a year, and the rate constantly
      changes. Sometimes they talk about interest “compounding” yearly,
      quarterly, monthly, daily or continuously. (“APR” is banker-speak for
      “continuously.”) That's the same approximation that we did above. The
      smaller the time span you look at, the closer you get to the ideal or
      continuous value. There are more details, of course. I'll leave those to
      your teacher.
    </p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      The derivative of f(x) is often written as f'(x), pronounced “F prime of
      X.” The derivate of y is often written as dy / dx, pronounced “the
      derivate of y with respect to x.”
    </p>
    <h1>Integrals</h1>
    <p>
      When you see the ∫ symbol, that means to take the integral of a function.
    </p>
    <h2>The Anti-Derivative</h2>
    <p>
      Integration and differentiation are inverses of each other. If g(x) is an
      integral of f(x) then f(x) is the derivative of g(x). That applies to all
      of the examples above. E.g. Position is the integral of speed. How did
      ships know their position before GPS was invented? One way is called dead
      reckoning. From time to time they would measure their speed. They would
      multiply each speed measurement by the amount of time they were going that
      speed, then add all the values together. That's the inverse of what we did
      in the derivative examples, above. The more often they measured their
      speed, the more accurate their estimate would be. If they could measure
      their speed constantly, they would know exactly where they were. But
      that's tricky. If they measure the speed constantly, they will have an
      infinite number of distances to add up. And each distance is a speed times
      a time, and the times are all 0. If you're not careful you'll get
      <code>∞ ⨉ 0</code>. But by this time you'll be an expert at limits, so you
      will know how to get a real answer.
    </p>
    <h2>Calculating the Anti-Derivative</h2>
    <p>
      How do you calculate an integral? One option is to look at all of the
      rules for computing derivatives, and to invert each of them. For example,
      we saw above that the derivative of <code>x²</code> is <code>2x</code>. So
      any time you have to integrate <code>2x</code>, you can look that up in
      your list and say <i>an</i> answer is <code>x²</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>An</i> answer. Remember, a derivative is just a fancy version of a
      slope, and more than one line can have the same slope. So more than one
      function can have the same derivative. So each function will have multiple
      anti-derivatives. The short version is that you need to write
      <code>+ C</code> at the end of your answer. So the integral of
      <code>2x</code> is <code>x² + C</code>. Your teacher will take off a lot
      of points of you forget the <code>+ C</code>!
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>C</code> is any number. That means that <code>x²</code>,
      <code>x² <b>+ 2</b></code
      >, <code>x² <b>+ 3</b></code
      >, <code>x² <b>+ 3.1</b></code
      >, <code>x² <b>+ π</b></code
      >, <code>x² <b>- 27</b></code
      >, etc., are all valid integrals of <code>2x</code>. This method is nice
      because it gives you an exact answer. However, this method can be
      difficult in some cases and impossible in others.
    </p>
    <h2>Definite vs Indefinite Integrals</h2>
    <p>
      The previous section begs an important question. Are you expecting a
      number or a formula for an answer? If you see a problem like
      <code>∫ 2x dx</code>, that's called an <i>indefinite</i> integral. The
      answer should look like <code>x² + C</code>, as described above. What if
      you wanted an exact value? You can't just plug in a number for
      <code>x</code>. Remember, <code>C</code> can be any number, so
      <code>x² + C</code> can be any number. That's not very helpful! Back to
      our boat example: What if we add up all of our measurements and got a
      total of 10 miles? That means the boat <i>moved</i> 10 miles. But that
      doesn't tell us the <i>position</i> of the boat. There could be two or
      more boats all going the same speed, but if they start at different
      positions they will end in different positions. Crudely speaking,
      <code>C</code> corresponds to the initial position of the boat. In
      practice, if you want an actual number from an integral, you will use
      what's called a <i>definite</i> integral. A <i>definite</i> integral looks
      just like an <i>indefinite</i> integral, except that the problem will
      specify a start value <i>and</i> an end value. In our boat example, you
      might ask how far did the boat move between 10am and 10:05. In our
      <code>2x</code> example you might ask what's the integral of
      <code>2x</code> between <code>x = 3</code> and <code>x = 7</code>. Those
      problems are both <i>definite</i> integrals.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Show examples of the symbol for a <i>definite</i> integral.
    </div>
    <p>
      If you know the <i>indefinite</i> integral of a function, then it is
      trivial to compute a <i>definite</i> integral of the same function. You
      compute the <i>indefinite</i> integral at the start and end values, and
      you subtract the second from the first. What's the integral of
      <code>2x</code> between <code>x = 3</code> and <code>x = 7</code>? Start
      with <code>x² + C</code>. For the end value we get <code>7² + C</code> and
      for the start value we get <code>3² + C</code>. So the answer will have to
      be <code>(7² + C) - (3² + C)</code>. The <code>C</code>'s cancel out to
      give us <code>7² - 3²</code> or <code>49 - 9</code> or <code>40</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>The Area Under the Curve</h2>
    <p>
      A different way to think about an integral is
      <i>the area under the curve</i>. Same problem: What's the integral of
      <code>2x</code> between <code>x = 3</code> and <code>x = 7</code>? Let's
      start by graphing <code>2x</code> and marking <code>x = 3</code> and
      <code>x = 7</code> on the same graph. The area I've highlighted in green
      is the answer we want. You could measure that with a ruler! Or you could
      notice that it's a trapezoid, and Google “area of a trapezoid” if you
      don't remember that formula. Or break it into a triangle and a rectangle
      if that's easier. Notice that when the original function is below the x
      axis, we subtract that from the total area. What if the function we are
      integrating is more complicated than a line? Break it into smaller pieces.
      Compute each piece separately then add them up. Like we've been doing!
      What if the function we are trying to integrate is a curve, not a set of
      line segments? Break it into small pieces then add them up. How small? It
      depends how accurate you want your estimate to be. But this method is not
      just for estimates. If you take the <i>limit</i> as the pieces get
      infinitely small, that will be the exact answer. The formal definition of
      an integral involves an infinite sum. And that's exactly what we did with
      the dead reckoning example, and with the area under the curve.
