# Overview

For #SoME3

I have some ideas I'd like to put into a document.
See [rough-draft.md](https://github.com/TradeIdeasPhilip/divide-by-zero/blob/master/rough-draft.md) for the words.
`!!!` means that I plan to add a picture.

Some pictures might require programming.
Some will come from Desmos.

The words seem pretty close to what I want.
The pictures will take some time.

# Problem

In Desmos I'm having trouble showing undefined points.

If I drag my mouse, Desmos will show the correct value at each place, including "(0, undefined)" where x=0.
But that's easy to miss.
Normally you'd draw a big open circle at that point.
I've tried a few things and nothing has worked well in Desmos.

# Test

I'm not sure how I want to format this document.
If I can use markdown that will make it easier to write the text.
If I can add an `<object>` tag then I can embed animations and interactive content.

<object data="https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/bounce-3d/#shadows=1"></object>

GitHub explicitly disables `<iframe>` in markdown.
