    <h1><a id="How_to_Divide_By_Zero"></a>How to Divide By Zero</h1>
    <p>
      How to divide by zero, and other things you will learn in highschool
      calculus. This will give you a <b>brief overview</b> of calculus. This
      will <i>not</i> replace your calculus textbook. This will help you
      understand what you are learning in class, and why. When I first learned
      calculus we focused on the mechanics of solving problems. I wish we’d
      spent more time discussing <b>why</b> we were learning these things and
      what they meant.

      You need to remember some algebra to understand this document. Here is a
      quick refresher of the relevant facts. You will need a lot more algebra
      when you are ready to actually solve calculus problems.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Graphs_of_Functions"></a>Graphs of Functions</h2>
    <p>
      You should be familiar with graphs of functions. Graphs are the easiest
      way to explain and understand calculus.
    </p>

      ><img src="./assets/0100-6ec0f952.png" />
      <div>
        <code>2 - x<span class="superscript">2</span></code> Click on any graph
        for an interactive version.
      </div></a
    >
    <p>
      The dark <i>horizontal</i> line is called “the x axis.” The numbers along
      this line are the inputs to the function. These are often things that you
      can change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark <i>vertical</i> line is called “the y axis.” the numbers along
      this line are the outputs from the function. If you give your computer or
      calculator an input to a function, it can compute the output of that
      function. Sometimes we say <code>f(x)</code> instead of “y.”
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Slope_of_a_Line"></a>Slope of a Line</h2>
    <p>
      Slope is defined as “<span style="color: pink">rise</span> over
      <span style="color: red">run</span>.”

    <p>
      In graph above you can see that the function moves
      <span style="color: pink">2 units <i>up</i></span> every time it moves
      <span style="color: red">3 units <i>to the right</i></span
      >. So the slope is <code>2 ÷ 3</code>, or ⅔.

      You could also say that the function moves

      <span style="color: blue">6 units up</span> each time it moves
      <span style="color: lightblue">9 units to the right</span>.
      <code>2 ÷ 3</code>, <code>4 ÷ 6</code>, and <code>6 ÷ 9</code> all give
      you the same answer, ⅔.

      has different values than
      <code class="with-border" style="border-color: red">f(x) = 2x ÷ 3</code>,
      but they both have the same slope.

      The next graph shows a line going down, so it has a negative slope. You
      can see that the function moves
      <span style="color: pink"
        >2 units <i><b>down</b></i></span
      >
      every time it moves
      <span style="color: red">3 units <i>to the right</i></span
      >. So the slope is <code>(-2) ÷ 3</code>, or -⅔.

    <h1><a id="Limits"></a>Limits</h1>
    <p>
      Limits are a way to divide by zero and otherwise make infinity work for
      you. In calculus class you will learn a more precise definition of limits,
      and a lot of rules to help you compute them. You might have to use limits
      directly to solve some problems. Mostly you learn about limits so you can
      understand the definitions of derivatives and integrals, described below.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Smoothness"></a>Smoothness</h2>
    <p>
      Calculus focuses on smooth functions. There is a formal definition of
      smoothness, but <b>your intuition is right</b>. Let’s look at some
      examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>2 - x<span class="superscript">2</span></code> (2 minus x squared)
      is smooth everywhere.
    </p>
    <a
      class="figure"

      target="_blank"
      ><img src="./assets/0100-6ec0f952.png" />
      <div>
        <code>2 - x<span class="superscript">2</span></code>
      </div></a
    >
    <p>
      <code>|x|</code> (the absolute value of x) is smooth everywhere except at
      x = 0.
    </p>
    <a
      class="figure"
      href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qggbuo5o0t"
      target="_blank"
      ><img src="./assets/0700-6c95f639.png" />
      <div><code>|x|</code></div></a
    >
    <p>
      <code>n!</code> (n factorial) is not continuous, so it can’t be smooth.
    </p>
    <a
      class="figure"
      href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/06k0kf256d"
      target="_blank"
      ><img src="./assets/0800-a540bba6.png" />
      <div><code>n!</code></div></a
    >
    <p>
      If you zoom into a smooth function <i>enough</i>, it will
      <i>eventually</i> look like a straight line. That makes the function very
      easy to predict.

      Smoothness is the <i>opposite</i> of a fractal. If a function looks like
      the Mandelbrot set, you probably can’t apply calculus to that function. No
      matter how much you zoom into the Mandelbrot set you’ll always find places
      where it is not smooth.

      The same goes for the natural fractals, like the coastline of Britain. No
      matter how much you zoom in to a natural coastline, you will always find
      more details. It will never look like a straight line. It will never be
      smooth.

      might simplify that to <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span></code

      second graph looked like! You could fill in that hole with anything you
      want, but only one value would make the function <i>smooth</i>.
      Congratulations, you just computed a limit! Calculus class will teach you
      when it is okay to use the complete version of the function, rather than
      the original version with the hole.

      If you see delta and epsilon in a problem, it is probably talking about
      limits. These are written with lowercase Greek letters: 𝛿 and 𝜺.

    <h1><a id="Derivatives"></a>Derivatives</h1>

    <h2><a id="Definition"></a>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      A derivate is a rate of change. For example, lets say
      <code>f(x)</code> tells us the total number of cookies in your house at a
      given time. Then the derivate of <code>f(x)</code> tells us how quickly
      you are eating those cookies or baking new ones.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ A graph. Y axis is labeled “cookies.” X axis is labeled “time.” A
      straight line is going down at a rate of 1 cookie per second. Avoid
      negative numbers.
    </div>
    <p>
      This graph shows that the number of cookies goes down over time. That
      means someone is eating your cookies! The graph would go up if you baked
      or bought more cookies. Also notice that <code>f(x)</code> is continuous
      and <i>smooth</i>. That means that someone is eating a little bit of a
      cookie at a time, continuously. Alternatively, what if whole cookies were
      disappearing at once? Then the graph might look like this.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Same scale and axes as as above. But we have a sequence of horizontal
      lines going down like a staircase. The lines will be in the same general
      position as in the previous graph. Like we took <i>samples</i> from the
      first graph, then tried to fill in the remaining spaces with a horizontal
      line segment. Each segment has a closed circle on the left and an open
      circle on the right.
    </div>
    <p>
      This function is <i>not</i> smooth everywhere. We can only talk about the
      derivative where it is smooth. Where it is not smooth, we say the derivate
      is not defined.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Derivate_of_a_Line"></a>Derivate of a Line</h2>
    <p>
      Our cookie example is a straight line. The derivative of a line is the
      slope of the line. In this case someone is eating one cookie per minute.
      The rate of change is -1 cookies per minute.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Smaller_Pieces"></a>Smaller Pieces</h2>
    <p>
      The following example is a little more complicated. You could say that the
      <i>average</i> rate of change for the first 5 minutes is -1, just like the
      previous graph. That’s correct, but it’s leaving out a lot of details.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw a graph where the main line follows the four sections below. Also
      draw a lighter or dotted line showing a straight line that starts ands
      ends at the same place. That should have a slope of -1.
    </div>
    <p>
      Let’s break the graph into pieces. - For the first minute the graph has a
      slope of 2, so the derivative in that section is 2. - For the next two
      minutes the slope is -1, and so is the derivative. - Then the graph jumps
      down by 5. - For the last two minutes the slope is 0, and so is the
      derivate. Here’s a graph of the derivative. Notice that the derivative is
      only defined where the original function is (a) defined, (b) continuous,
      and (c) smooth.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Really_Small_Pieces"></a>Really Small Pieces</h2>
    <p>So, what’s the derivative of x<span class="superscript">2</span>?</p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw a graph of x<span class="superscript">2</span>. x goes from -1 to
      4. To save space y goes from -1 to 10. So the line will go off the top of
      the graph somewhere between x=3 and x=4. Label the x axis with an “x”.
      Label the y axis with “y = x<span class="superscript">2</span>”.
    </div>
    <p>
      You could say that the <i>average</i> rate of change between 0 and 1 is 1.
      And the average rate of change between 1 and 2 is 3. If you keep going
      you’ll get a graph like this for the derivative x<span class="superscript"
        >2</span
      >.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Keep the previous graph and add new lines in a different color. Draw
      straight lines connecting this series of points (-1, 1), (0,0), (1,1),
      (2,4), (3,9), (4,16). Add a second graph below the first. The x axis
      scales should line up perfectly. The y axis on the bottom should be
      labeled “y’ = the derivative of x<span class="superscript">2</span>”. Fill
      in the values. These should each be horizontal segments with open circles
      on both sides.
    </div>
    <p>
      But there’s no reason to break things up that way. What if you asked for
      the average every time x changes by ½? Then the answers would look like
      this graph.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Just like the previous pair of graphs, but draw twice as many points.
      x=0, x=0.5, x=1, x=1.5, etc.
    </div>
    <p>
      As you look at smaller and smaller sections, you see more an more detail.
      How small can we make the sections?
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Similar to previous two illustrations, but make the sections much
      smaller. Look at the result to decide how small to make these. It should
      still be obvious that these are separate segments, but, clearly getting
      closer to smooth.
    </div>
    <p>
      As we get closer and closer to 0, the answer gets better and better. What
      if we asked about a change of 0? Every time x moves 0 units to the right,
      x<span class="superscript">2</span> moves 0 units up. And
      <code>0 ÷ 0</code> = <i>what?</i>
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw 2 graphs. On top, just x<span class="superscript">2</span> without
      anything else. On the bottom draw the graph of 2x.
    </div>
    <p>
      And that’s why we learn limits before we learn derivatives. When you work
      out the problem in class you’ll eventually learn that the derivative of
      <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span></code> is <code>2x</code>,
      matching what we see on the graph. But along the way to
      <code>2x</code> you’d see something (roughly) similar to
      <code>2x<span class="superscript">2</span> ÷ x</code>. Because you know
      limits you can simplify
      <code>2x<span class="superscript">2</span> ÷ x</code> to
      <code>2x</code> without being afraid to divide by 0.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Physics_Examples"></a>Physics Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Derivatives are used a lot in physics. For example, if f(x) is the
      <i>position</i> of your car at time x, then the derivative of f(x) will
      tell you the <i>speed</i> you are going.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Draw two charts, one on top of the other with matching scales for the x
      axes, as in the previous section. label the x axis for both “x =
      position”. The y axis for the top graph is “y = distance (miles)”, for the
      bottom graph “y = speed (miles/hour)”. Mark the first part of the x axis
      “my neighborhood”, the second part “surface roads”, the third part
      “freeway,” and the fourth part “surface roads,” again. The position graph
      will be a little wavy, but definitely the slowest in the neighborhood and
      the fastest on the freeway. Draw light/thin lines on the top chart, like
      before, from the beginning to the end of each section. On the bottom chart
      show two different lines in different colors. One labeled average speed,
      and the other labeled speed.
    </div>
    <p>
      Just like in the example above, you can talk about the average speed for
      your entire trip. Or you can talk about the average speed for various
      parts of your trip. You can get more precise answers if you look at
      smaller and smaller time intervals. And, if you ask for the
      <i>exact</i> speed at an <i>exact</i> instant in time, that’s the
      derivative. Acceleration is the derivative of speed. Electric current is
      the derivative of charge. Etc.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Interest_Rates"></a>Interest Rates</h2>
    <p>
      Interest is money the bank puts into your your account. Your account
      balance will change over time because the bank is adding money. If
      <code>f(x)</code> represents your bank balance, then the derivate of
      <code>f(x)</code> says how quickly the bank is adding money. Bankers often
      quote interest rates in different ways. They might quote a rate for a
      year. But they add money more than once a year, and the rate constantly
      changes. Sometimes they talk about interest “compounding” yearly,
      quarterly, monthly, daily or continuously. (“APR” is banker-speak for
      “continuously.”) That’s the same approximation that we did above. The
      smaller the time span you look at, the closer you get to the ideal or
      continuous value. There are more details, of course. I’ll leave those to
      your teacher.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Terminology"></a>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      The derivative of <code>f(x)</code> is often written as
      <code>f′(x)</code>, pronounced “F prime of X.” The derivate of y is often
      written as <code>dy / dx</code>, pronounced “the derivate of y with
      respect to x.”

      When you see the ∫ symbol, that means to take the integral of a function.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="The_Anti_Derivative"></a>The Anti-Derivative</h2>
    <p>
      Integration and differentiation are inverses of each other. If g(x) is an
      integral of f(x) then f(x) is the derivative of g(x). That applies to all
      of the examples above. E.g. Position is the integral of speed. How did
      ships know their position before GPS was invented? One way is called dead
      reckoning. From time to time they would measure their speed. They would
      multiply each speed measurement by the amount of time they were going that
      speed, then add all the values together. That’s the inverse of what we did
      in the derivative examples, above. The more often they measured their
      speed, the more accurate their estimate would be. If they could measure
      their speed constantly, they would know exactly where they were. But
      that’s tricky. If they measure the speed constantly, they will have an
      infinite number of distances to add up. And each distance is a speed times
      a time, and the times are all 0. If you’re not careful you’ll get
      <code>∞ ⨉ 0</code>. But by this time you’ll be an expert at limits, so you
      will know how to get a real answer.

    <h2>
      <a id="Calculating_the_Anti_Derivative"></a>Calculating the
      Anti-Derivative
    </h2>
    <p>
      How do you calculate an integral? One option is to look at all of the
      rules for computing derivatives, and to invert each of them. For example,
      we saw above that the derivative of
      <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span></code> is <code>2x</code>. So
      any time you have to integrate <code>2x</code>, you can look that up in
      your list and say <i>an</i> answer is
      <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span></code
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>An</i> answer. Remember, a derivative is just a fancy version of a
      slope, and more than one line can have the same slope. So more than one
      function can have the same derivative. So each function will have multiple
      anti-derivatives. The short version is that you need to write
      <code>+ C</code> at the end of your answer. So the integral of
      <code>2x</code> is <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> + C</code>.
      Your teacher will take off a lot of points of you forget the
      <code>+ C</code>!
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>C</code> is any number. That means that
      <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span></code
      >, <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> <b>+ 2</b></code
      >, <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> <b>+ 3</b></code
      >, <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> <b>+ 3.1</b></code
      >, <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> <b>+ π</b></code
      >, <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> <b>- 27</b></code
      >, etc., are all valid integrals of <code>2x</code>. This method is nice
      because it gives you an exact answer. However, this method can be
      difficult in some cases and impossible in others.

    <h2>
      <a id="Definite_vs_Indefinite_Integrals"></a>Definite vs Indefinite
      Integrals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The previous section begs an important question. Are you expecting a
      number or a formula for an answer? If you see a problem like
      <code>∫ 2x dx</code>, that’s called an <i>indefinite</i> integral. The
      answer should look like
      <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> + C</code>, as described above.
      What if you wanted an exact value? You can’t just plug in a number for
      <code>x</code>. Remember, <code>C</code> can be any number, so
      <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> + C</code> can be any number.
      That’s not very helpful! Back to our boat example: What if we add up all
      of our measurements and got a total of 10 miles? That means the boat
      <i>moved</i> 10 miles. But that doesn’t tell us the <i>position</i> of the
      boat. There could be two or more boats all going the same speed, but if
      they start at different positions they will end in different positions.
      Crudely speaking, <code>C</code> corresponds to the initial position of
      the boat. In practice, if you want an actual number from an integral, you
      will use what’s called a <i>definite</i> integral. A
      <i>definite</i> integral looks just like an <i>indefinite</i> integral,
      except that the problem will specify a start value <i>and</i> an end
      value. In our boat example, you might ask how far did the boat move
      between 10am and 10:05. In our <code>2x</code> example you might ask
      what’s the integral of <code>2x</code> between <code>x = 3</code> and
      <code>x = 7</code>. Those problems are both <i>definite</i> integrals.
    </p>
    <div class="phil-notes">
      ‼️ Show examples of the symbol for a <i>definite</i> integral.
    </div>
    <p>
      If you know the <i>indefinite</i> integral of a function, then it is
      trivial to compute a <i>definite</i> integral of the same function. You
      compute the <i>indefinite</i> integral at the start and end values, and
      you subtract the second from the first. What’s the integral of
      <code>2x</code> between <code>x = 3</code> and <code>x = 7</code>? Start
      with <code>x<span class="superscript">2</span> + C</code>. For the end
      value we get <code>7<span class="superscript">2</span> + C</code> and for
      the start value we get
      <code>3<span class="superscript">2</span> + C</code>. So the answer will
      have to be
      <code
        >(7<span class="superscript">2</span> + C) - (3<span class="superscript"
          >2</span
        >
        + C)</code
      >. The <code>C</code>’s cancel out to give us
      <code
        >7<span class="superscript">2</span> - 3<span class="superscript"
          >2</span
        ></code
      >
      or <code>49 - 9</code> or <code>40</code>.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="The_Area_Under_the_Curve"></a>The Area Under the Curve</h2>
    <p>
      A different way to think about an integral is
      <i>the area under the curve</i>. Same problem: What’s the integral of
      <code>2x</code> between <code>x = 3</code> and <code>x = 7</code>? Let’s
      start by graphing <code>2x</code> and marking <code>x = 3</code> and
      <code>x = 7</code> on the same graph. The area I’ve highlighted in green
      is the answer we want. You could measure that with a ruler! Or you could
      notice that it’s a trapezoid, and Google “area of a trapezoid” if you
      don’t remember that formula. Or break it into a triangle and a rectangle
      if that’s easier. Notice that when the original function is below the x
      axis, we subtract that from the total area. What if the function we are
      integrating is more complicated than a line? Break it into smaller pieces.
      Compute each piece separately then add them up. Like we’ve been doing!
      What if the function we are trying to integrate is a curve, not a set of
      line segments? Break it into small pieces then add them up. How small? It
      depends how accurate you want your estimate to be. But this method is not
      just for estimates. If you take the <i>limit</i> as the pieces get
      infinitely small, that will be the exact answer. The formal definition of
      an integral involves an infinite sum. And that’s exactly what we did with
      the dead reckoning example, and with the area under the curve.
