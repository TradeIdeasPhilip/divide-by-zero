    <h2>Font for Main Text</h2>
    <h3>Playfair</h3>
    <div style="font-family: 'Playfair', serif">
      <p>
        hello world <b>Bold</b> <i>italic</i> <b><i>bold & italic</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a simple font. I like the way it's very round.
        <i>And the italic version is a lot of fun.</i> Very noticeable and still
        easy to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's tricky. If they measure the speed constantly, they will have
        an infinite number of distances to add up. And each distance is a speed
        times a time, and the times are all 0. If you're not careful you'll get
        <code>∞ ⨉ 0</code>. But by this time you'll be an expert at limits, so
        you will know how to get a real answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will give you an <b>overview</b> of calculus. This will
        <i>not</i> replace your calculus textbook.
      </p>

    <h3>Noto Serif Kannada</h3>
    <div style="font-family: 'Noto Serif Kannada', serif">
      <p>
        hello world <b>Bold</b> <i>italic</i> <b><i>bold & italic</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to Playfair. But the kerning looking more natural. And this font
        says it has a lot of support for foreign languages and other special
        characters. Bold is more obvious in Noto Serif Kannada but italic is
        more obvious in Playfair.

        hello world <b style="font-stretch: expanded">Bold</b> <i>italic</i>
        <b><i>bold & italic</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of fun, yet still very readable. Especially some letters: fygker.
        Bold doesn't work at all. That's a killer for this project, but I think
        this font would work well in the right context.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: x-large">
        The text is readable even in
        <span style="font-size: small">small sizes</span>, but the flourishes
        are most obvious when the text is bigger. fygker

    <h3>Cormorant Upright</h3>
    <div style="font-family: 'Cormorant Upright', serif; font-weight: 500">
      <p>
        hello world <b style="font-stretch: expanded">Bold</b> <i>italic</i>
        <b><i>bold & italic</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400">normal</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of fun, yet still readable. It's upright, but it's drawn with the
        flourishes of a hand drawn italic font. The default font weight was a
        little too light, so I made it darker by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        It still seems kinda small, especially right next to gabriela.
        <span style="font-size: 110%">One hundred ten percent.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 125%">One hundred twenty-five percent.</span>
        It's more than that. The font still has a light weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only for comparison: fygker
        <span style="font-size: x-large">fygker</span>. Gabriela has a few
        letters that are more interesting than the rest. In Cormorant Upright
        all of the letters are interesting.

        This is a simple, easy to read font. Mostly it's pretty normal. But
        notice: WAeaæ. I don't like the numbers, especially zero: 1234567890.

        This font is mostly pretty normal.
        <b>Bold is defined on a continuous axis and looks goods.</b>
        <i
          >Italic is not as obvious as you might expect, because it's not
          leaning over, but it does look good.</i
        >
        interesting letters: T Th ff fi &$÷½. And I like the numbers:
        1234567890. They are easy to ready, almost normal, but somehow a little
        fancy. Only for comparison: WAeaæ.
